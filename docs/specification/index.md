## Current Version
The current version of GBFS is [v3.0-RC](reference).  

As described in the [GBFS governance](process),

* **Implementation requirements are that at least 1 producer and 1 consumer implement the changes.**
* **The implementors MUST be stakeholders other than The Advocate (who opened the PR).**
* **Once implemented successfully, the change is merged into an official current release.**
