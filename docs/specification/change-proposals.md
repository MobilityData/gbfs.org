**[Geofencing refactor](https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs/pull/481)**

The community has been working on a refactor of the `geofencing_zones.json` file. The geofencing endpoint was added to the specification starting with `v2.1` in early 2020. Since that time we've heard that it has been a source of confusion for both data producers and consumers. A PR has been opened proposing some potential improvements to the endpoint. To learn more or get involved please refer to [Pull Request #481](https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs/pull/481) on the GBFS repo.
