As described in the [GBFS governance](process), when changes are made to the specification, the changes are placed into Release Candidate (RC) status. The changes remain in RC status pending implementation.

* **Implementation requirements are that at least 1 producer and 1 consumer implement the changes.**
* **The implementors MUST be stakeholders other than The Advocate (who opened the PR).**
* **Once implemented successfully, the change is merged into an official current release.**

To support this process and ensure it is as timely as possible, MobilityData tracks implementation through one-on-one discussions and other stakeholder events and by examining GBFS datasets. To improve this tracking process, GBFS data producers and consumers are encouraged to add their organization here if they have implemented or are planning on implementing any of these release candidate changes. After votes are called, MobilityData will update this list to reflect organizations that included an implementation note in their vote.
### First Adopters
ðŸŽ‰ Shoutout to the first adopters! These organizations invest a large amount of time and energy to implement the changes contained in the Release Candidate and make sure that GBFS continues to evolve.

- Producers: [Check](https://ridecheck.app/en), [Flamingo](https://flamingoscooters.com/), [TIER](https://www.tier.app/).
- Consumers: [ENTUR](https://entur.no/), [Transit](https://transitapp.com/?lang=fr), [transport.data.gouv.fr](https://transport.data.gouv.fr/), [Where To?](https://www.whereto.app/).
### Implementation Status
The following items have passed through the voting process and will be included in the next version.

## Extensions Outside of the Specification

To accommodate the needs of feed producers and consumers prior to the adoption of a change, additional fields can be added to feeds even if these fields are not part of the official specification. Custom extensions that may provide value to the GBFS community and align with the [GBFS Guiding Principles](https://github.com/MobilityData/gbfs/blob/master/README.md#guiding-principles) should be proposed for inclusion in the specification through the change process.

Field names of extensions should be prefixed with an underscore (_) character. It is strongly recommended that these additional fields be documented here in this format:
