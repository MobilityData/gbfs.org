## Contributing to GBFS

GBFS is an open source project developed under a consensus-based governance model. Contributors come from across the shared mobility industry, public sector, civic technology and elsewhere. Anyone can propose a change to the specification by opening a pull request on the GBFS GitHub repository.

All change proposals are subject to the GBFS governance process.

- The proposal must remain open for a period of time to allow the committee to give feedback and iterate on the proposed change.
- Once a consensus is reached, the change goes to a vote.
- At least 3 votes in favor, and none opposed, are required for the change to be adopted. One vote must be from a data producer and one from a data consumer. The party proposing the change is not eligible to vote.
- When a vote passes, the change becomes part of a Release Candidate.
- Once both a data producer and a date consumer have implemented the change, the Release Candidate becomes an official version release.

**[See the Governance Process](../documentation/process)**

To support this process and ensure it is as timely as possible, MobilityData tracks implementation through one-on-one discussions and other stakeholder events and by examining GBFS datasets. To improve this tracking process, GBFS data producers and consumers are encouraged to add their organization here if they have implemented or are planning on implementing any of these release candidate changes. After votes are called, MobilityData will update this list to reflect organizations that included an implementation note in their vote.
