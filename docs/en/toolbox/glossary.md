# Glossary

- **API** - An API (Application Program Interface) is a connection between computers or computer programs. APS are used to transmit data in order to offer services to other computers or pieces of software. A document describes how to build and use an API is called and API specification. GBFS is an API specification.

- **Consumer** - A consumer is someone who is consuming and using GBFS data. Examples of GBFS consumers are trip planning or MaaS applications, researchers and regulators.

- **Deep link** - In the context of mobile apps, deep links enable linking to specific locations within an app rather than simply launching the app. GBFS deep links can be used to check if the user has a mobility service provider’s app installed on their phone. If the app is installed, the user can be sent directly to the point of purchase for the vehicle they wish to rent within the app - significantly improving the user experience. If the app is not installed , they can be directed to the appropriate app store for download before continuing with the rental process.

- **Endpoint** - An endpoint is the specific digital location where a resource lives. GBFS endpoints are URLs that point to each of the files in a GBFS data set. The `gbfs.json` file contains a list of all the available endpoints in a gbfs data set.

- **Feed** - A feed, in the context of GBFS, is another name for an API endpoint or collection of endpoints. The term feed may be used in reference to a single file or the collection of files that make up a GBFS implementation.

- **Geofencing** - A geofence is a virtual boundary that defines a geographic area. When a shared mobility vehicle enters or exits a geofenced area, events can be triggered, for example a push notification can be sent to a user’s phone. Geofencing may be used to delineate pick up and drop off zones, no-ride zones, speed limit zones, equity zones, etc.

- **Producer** - A producer is any entity that is publishing GBFS, most often producers are shared mobility system operators. Producer is sometimes used interchangeably with provider.

- **Station** - A station is a location where shared mobility vehicles are made available for rent. Stations may include physical infrastructure like rental kiosks, docks or racks, or they may be virtual, delineated by pavement markings, geofencing or other means.

- **System** - A system in the context of GBFS is a shared mobility service from a single provider represented by e GBFS data set. Systems are typically limited to the local geography in which they operate. A single mobility service provider may operate in many geographic locations, each of which would be considered a separate system. Systems may span municipal or political boundaries in cases where vehicles are permitted to operate across multiple jurisdictions. If a user could reasonably expect to be able to rent a vehicle in one jurisdiction and return it in another, those jurisdictions would be considered a single system.

- **Vehicle** - A system’s fleet is made up of individual vehicles. Some systems may have multiple vehicle types, whereas others may only have one. Examples of shared mobility vehicles are bikes, ebikes, scooters, mopeds and automobiles.
