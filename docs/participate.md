## Contributing to GBFS

GBFS is an open source project developed under a consensus-based governance model. Contributors come from across the shared mobility industry, public sector, civic technology and elsewhere. Anyone can propose a change to the specification by opening a pull request on the GBFS GitHub repository.

All change proposals are subject to the GBFS governance process.

- The proposal must remain open for a period of time to allow the committee to give feedback and iterate on the proposed change.
- Once a consensus is reached, the change goes to a vote.
- At least 3 votes in favor, and none opposed, are required for the change to be adopted. One vote must be from a data producer and one from a data consumer. The party proposing the change is not eligible to vote.
- When a vote passes, the change becomes part of a Release Candidate.
- Once both a data producer and a date consumer have implemented the change, the Release Candidate becomes an official version release.
