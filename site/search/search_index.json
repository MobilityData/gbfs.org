Reference version \u00b6 This documentation refers to v2.2 . For past and upcoming versions see the README . Terminology \u00b6 The key words \"MUST\", \"MUST NOT\", \"REQUIRED\", \"SHALL\", \"SHALL NOT\", \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", \"NOT RECOMMENDED\", \"MAY\", and \"OPTIONAL\" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 , BCP 14 and RFC8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here. Table of Contents \u00b6 Introduction Version Endpoints Term Definitions Files Accessibility File Requirements Licensing Field Types Files gbfs.json gbfs_versions.json (added in v1.1) system_information.json vehicle_types.json (added in v2.1) station_information.json station_status.json free_bike_status.json system_hours.json system_calendar.json system_regions.json system_pricing_plans.json system_alerts.json geofencing_zones.json (added in v2.1) Deep Links - Analytics and Examples (added in v1.1) Introduction \u00b6 This specification has been designed with the following concepts in mind: Provide the status of the system at this moment Do not provide information whose primary purpose is historical The specification supports real-time travel advice in GBFS-consuming applications. Version Endpoints \u00b6 The version of the GBFS specification to which a feed conforms is declared in the version field in all files. See Output Format . GBFS Best Practice defines that: GBFS producers SHOULD provide endpoints that conform to both the current specification long term support (LTS) branch as well as the latest release branch within at least 3 months of a new spec MAJOR or MINOR version release. It is not necessary to support more than one MINOR release of the same MAJOR release group because MINOR releases are backwards-compatible. See specification versioning GBFS consumers SHOULD, at a minimum, support the current LTS branch. It is highly RECOMMENDED that GBFS consumers support later releases. Default GBFS feed URLs, e.g. https://www.example.com/data/gbfs.json or https://www.example.com/data/fr/system_information.json MUST direct consumers to the feed that conforms to the current LTS documentation branch. Term Definitions \u00b6 This section defines terms that are used throughout this document. JSON - (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight format for storing and transporting data. This document uses many terms defined by the JSON standard, including field, array, and object. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_datatypes.asp) Field - In JSON, a name/value pair consists of a field name (in double quotes), followed by a colon, followed by a value. (https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_json_syntax.asp) GeoJSON - GeoJSON is a format for encoding a variety of geographic data structures. (https://geojson.org/) REQUIRED - The field MUST be included in the dataset, and a value MUST be provided in that field for each record. OPTIONAL - The field MAY be omitted from the dataset. If an OPTIONAL column is included, some of the entries in that field MAY be empty strings. An omitted field is equivalent to a field that is empty. Conditionally REQUIRED - The field or file is REQUIRED under certain conditions, which are outlined in the field or file description. Outside of these conditions, this field or file is OPTIONAL. Files \u00b6 File Name REQUIRED Defines gbfs.json Yes (as of v2.0) Auto-discovery file that links to all of the other files published by the system. gbfs_versions.json (added in v1.1) OPTIONAL Lists all feed endpoints published according to versions of the GBFS documentation. system_information.json Yes Details including system operator, system location, year implemented, URL, contact info, time zone. vehicle_types.json (added in v2.1) Conditionally REQUIRED Describes the types of vehicles that System operator has available for rent. REQUIRED of systems that include information about vehicle types in the free_bike_status file. If this file is not included, then all vehicles in the feed are assumed to be non-motorized bicycles. station_information.json Conditionally REQUIRED List of all stations, their capacities and locations. REQUIRED of systems utilizing docks. station_status.json Conditionally REQUIRED Number of available vehicles and docks at each station and station availability. REQUIRED of systems utilizing docks. free_bike_status.json Conditionally REQUIRED (as of v2.1) Describes all vehicles that are not currently in active rental. REQUIRED for free floating (dockless) vehicles. OPTIONAL for station based (docked) vehicles. Vehicles that are part of an active rental MUST NOT appear in this feed. system_hours.json OPTIONAL Hours of operation for the system. system_calendar.json OPTIONAL Dates of operation for the system. system_regions.json OPTIONAL Regions the system is broken up into. system_pricing_plans.json OPTIONAL System pricing scheme. system_alerts.json OPTIONAL Current system alerts. geofencing_zones.json (added in v2.1) OPTIONAL Geofencing zones and their associated rules and attributes. Accessibility \u00b6 Datasets SHOULD be published at an easily accessible, public, permanent URL. (e.g., www.agency.org/gbfs/v2-2/gbfs.json). The URL SHOULD be directly available without requiring login to access the file to facilitate download by consuming software applications. To be compliant with GBFS, all systems MUST have an entry in the systems.csv file. Feed Availability \u00b6 Automated tools for application performance monitoring SHOULD be used to ensure feed availability. Producers SHOULD provide a technical contact who can respond to feed outages in the feed_contact_email field in the system_information.json file. Seasonal Shutdowns, Disruptions of Service \u00b6 Feeds SHOULD continue to be published during seasonal or temporary shutdowns. Feed URLs SHOULD NOT return a 404. An empty bikes array SHOULD be returned by free_bike_status.json . Stations in station_status.json SHOULD be set to is_renting:false , is_returning:false and is_installed:false where applicable. Seasonal shutdown dates SHOULD be reflected in system_calendar.json . Announcements for disruptions of service, including disabled stations or temporary closures of stations or systems SHOULD be made in system_alerts.json . File Requirements \u00b6 All files SHOULD be valid JSON All files in the spec MAY be published at a URL path or with an alternate name (e.g., station_info instead of station_information.json ) (as of v2.0) . All data SHOULD be UTF-8 encoded Line breaks SHOULD be represented by unix newline characters only (\\n) Pagination is not supported. File Distribution \u00b6 Files are distributed as individual HTTP endpoints. REQUIRED files MUST NOT 404. They MUST return a properly formatted JSON file as defined in Output Format . OPTIONAL files MAY 404. A 404 of an OPTIONAL file SHOULD NOT be considered an error. Auto-Discovery \u00b6 Publishers SHOULD implement auto-discovery of GBFS feeds by linking to the location of the gbfs.json auto-discovery endpoint. * The location of the auto-discovery file SHOULD be provided in the HTML area of the shared mobility landing page hosted at the URL specified in the URL field of the system_infomation.json file. This is referenced via a link tag with the following format: <link rel=\"gbfs\" type=\"application/json\" href=\"https://www.example.com/data/gbfs.json\" /> References: http://microformats.org/wiki/existing-rel-values http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-faq#How_is_rel_used A shared mobility landing page MAY contain links to auto-discovery files for multiple systems. Localization \u00b6 Each set of data files SHOULD be distributed in a single language as defined in system_information.json. A system that wants to publish feeds in multiple languages SHOULD do so by publishing multiple distributions, such as: https://www.example.com/data/en/system_information.json https://www.example.com/data/fr/system_information.json Text Fields and Naming \u00b6 Rich text SHOULD NOT be stored in free form text fields. Fields SHOULD NOT contain HTML. All customer-facing text strings (including station names) SHOULD use Mixed Case (not ALL CAPS), following local conventions for capitalization of place names on displays capable of displaying lower case characters. Examples: Central Park South Villiers-sur-Marne Market Street Abbreviations SHOULD NOT be used for names and other text (e.g. St. for Street) unless a location is called by its abbreviated name (e.g. \u201cJFK Airport\u201d). Abbreviations may be problematic for accessibility by screen reader software and voice user interfaces. Consuming software can be engineered to reliably convert full words to abbreviations for display, but converting from abbreviations to full words is prone to more risk of error. Names used for stations, virtual stations and geofenced areas SHOULD be human readable. Naming conventions used for locations SHOULD consider a variety of use cases including both text and maps. Descriptions SHOULD NOT include information so specific that it could be used in tracking of vehicles or trips. Coordinate Precision \u00b6 Feeds SHOULD provide 6 digits (0.000001) of precision for decimal degrees lat/lon coordinates. Decimal places Degrees Distance at the Equator 0 1.0 111 km 1 0.1 11.1 km 2 0.01 1.11 km 3 0.001 111 m 4 0.0001 11.1 m 5 0.00001 1.11 m 6 0.000001 0.11 m 7 0.0000001 1.11 cm Data Latency \u00b6 The data returned by the near-realtime endpoints station_status.json and free_bike_status.json SHOULD be as close to realtime as possible, but in no case should it be more than 5 minutes out-of-date. Appropriate values SHOULD be set using the ttl property for each endpoint based on how often the data in feeds are refreshed or updated. For near-realtime endpoints where the data should always be refreshed the ttl value SHOULD be 0 . The last_updated timestamp represents the publisher's knowledge of the current state of the system at this point in time. The last_reported timestamp represents the last time a station or vehicle reported its status to the operator's backend. Licensing \u00b6 It is RECOMMENDED that all GBFS data sets be offered under an open data license. Open data licenses allow consumers to freely use, modify and share GBFS data for any purpose in perpetuity. Licensing of GBFS data provides certainty to GBFS consumers, allowing them to integrate GBFS data into their work. All GBFS data sets SHOULD specify a license using the license_id field with an SPDX identifier or by using the license_url field with a URL pointing to a custom license in system_information.json . See the GBFS repo for a comparison of a subset of standard licenses . Field Types \u00b6 Array - A JSON element consisting of an ordered sequence of zero or more values. Boolean - One of two possible values, true or false . Boolean values MUST be JSON booleans, not strings (i.e. true or false , not \"true\" or \"false\" ). (as of v2.0) Date - Service day in the YYYY-MM-DD format. Example: 2019-09-13 for September 13th, 2019. Email - An email address. Example: example@example.com Enum (Enumerable values) - An option from a set of predefined constants in the \"Defines\" column. Enum values SHOULD be lowercase. Example: The rental_methods field contains values creditcard , paypass , etc... Float (added in v2.1) - A 32-bit floating point number. GeoJSON FeatureCollection - A FeatureCollection as described by the IETF RFC 7946 https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.3. GeoJSON Multipolygon - A Geometry Object as described by the IETF RFC https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946#section-3.1.7. ID - Should be represented as a string that identifies that particular entity. An ID: MUST be unique within like fields (e.g. station_id MUST be unique among stations) does not have to be globally unique, unless otherwise specified MUST NOT contain spaces MUST be persistent for a given entity (station, plan, etc). An exception is floating bike bike_id , which MUST NOT be persistent for privacy reasons (see free_bike_status.json ). (as of v2.0) Language - An IETF BCP 47 language code. For an introduction to IETF BCP 47, refer to http://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt and http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/. Examples: en for English, en-US for American English, or de for German. Latitude - WGS84 latitude in decimal degrees. The value MUST be greater than or equal to -90.0 and less than or equal to 90.0. Example: 41.890169 for the Colosseum in Rome. Longitude - WGS84 longitude in decimal degrees. The value MUST be greater than or equal to -180.0 and less than or equal to 180.0. Example: 12.492269 for the Colosseum in Rome. Non-negative Float - A 32-bit floating point number greater than or equal to 0. Non-negative Integer - An integer greater than or equal to 0. Object - A JSON element consisting of key-value pairs (fields). String - Can only contain text. Strings MUST NOT contain any formatting codes (including HTML) other than newlines. Time - Service time in the HH:MM:SS format for the time zone indicated in system_information.json (00:00:00 - 47:59:59). Time can stretch up to one additional day in the future to accommodate situations where, for example, a system was open from 11:30pm - 11pm the next day (i.e. 23:30:00-47:00:00). Timestamp - Timestamp fields MUST be represented as integers in POSIX time. (e.g., the number of seconds since January 1st 1970 00:00:00 UTC) Timezone - TZ timezone from the https://www.iana.org/time-zones. Timezone names never contain the space character but MAY contain an underscore. Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_zones for a list of valid values. Example: Asia/Tokyo , America/Los_Angeles or Africa/Cairo . URI (added in v1.1) - A fully qualified URI that includes the scheme (e.g., com.abcrental.android:// ), and any special characters in the URI MUST be correctly escaped. See the following http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description of how to create fully qualified URI values. Note that URIs MAY be URLs. URL - A fully qualified URL that includes http:// or https:// , and any special characters in the URL MUST be correctly escaped. See the following http://www.w3.org/Addressing/URL/4_URI_Recommentations.html for a description of how to create fully qualified URL values. Extensions Outside of the Specification \u00b6 To accommodate the needs of feed producers and consumers prior to the adoption of a change, additional fields can be added to feeds even if these fields are not part of the official specification. Custom extensions that may provide value to the GBFS community and align with the GBFS Guiding Principles SHOULD be proposed for inclusion in the specification through the change process. Field names of extensions SHOULD be prefixed with an underscore ( _) character. It is strongly RECOMMENDED that these additional fields be documented on the wiki page of the GBFS repository in this format: Submitted by Field Name File Name Defines Publisher's name _field_name Name of GBFS endpoint where field is used Description of purpose of use JSON Files \u00b6 Output Format \u00b6 Every JSON file presented in this specification contains the same common header information at the top level of the JSON response object: Field Name REQUIRED Type Defines last_updated Yes Timestamp Indicates the last time data in the feed was updated. This timestamp represents the publisher's knowledge of the current state of the system at this point in time. ttl Yes Non-negative integer Number of seconds before the data in the feed will be updated again (0 if the data should always be refreshed). version (added in v1.1) Yes String GBFS version number to which the feed confirms, according to the versioning framework. data Yes Object Response data in the form of name:value pairs. Example: \u00b6 { \"last_updated\" : 1609866247 , \"ttl\" : 3600 , \"version\" : \"2.2\" , \"data\" : { \"name\" : \"Citi Bike\" , \"system_id\" : \"citibike_com\" } } gbfs.json \u00b6 The gbfs.json discovery file SHOULD represent a single system or geographic area in which vehicles are operated. The location (URL) of the gbfs.json file SHOULD be made available to the public using the specification\u2019s auto-discovery function. Field Name REQUIRED Type Defines language Yes Language The language that will be used throughout the rest of the files. It MUST match the value in the system_information.json file. - feeds Yes Array An array of all of the feeds that are published by this auto-discovery file. Each element in the array is an object with the keys below. \u2003- name Yes String Key identifying the type of feed this is.

This URL SHOULD be a deep link specific to this vehicle, and SHOULD NOT be a general rental page that includes information for more than one vehicle. The deep link SHOULD take users directly to this vehicle, without any prompts, interstitial pages, or logins. Make sure that users can see this vehicle even if they never previously opened the application. Note that as a best practice providers SHOULD rotate identifiers within deep links after each rental to avoid unintentionally exposing private vehicle trip origins and destinations. If this field is empty, it means deep linking isn\u2019t supported for web browsers.

If string, MUST be in decimal monetary value. (added in v2.2) Note: v3.0 may only allow non-negative float, therefore future implementations SHOULD be non-negative float. In case of non-rate price, this field is the total price. In case of rate price, this field is the base price that is charged only once per trip (e.g., price for unlocking) in addition to per_km_pricing and/or per_min_pricing . - is_taxable Yes Boolean Will additional tax be added to the base price? true - Yes. false - No. false MAY be used to indicate that tax is not charged or that tax is included in the base price. - description Yes String Customer-readable description of the pricing plan. This SHOULD include the duration, price, conditions, etc. that the publisher would like users to see. - per_km_pricing (added in v2.2) OPTIONAL Array Array of segments when the price is a function of distance travelled, displayed in kilometers. Total price is the addition of price and all segments in per_km_pricing and per_min_pricing . If this array is not provided, there are no variable prices based on distance. \u2003\u2003- start (added in v2.2) Yes Non-Negative Integer The kilometer at which this segment rate starts being charged (inclusive) . \u2003\u2003- rate (added in v2.2) Yes Float Rate that is charged for each kilometer interval after the start .

Examples (added in v2.2) \u00b6 Example 1: \u00b6 The user does not pay more than the base price for the first 10 km. After 10 km the user pays $1 per km. After 25 km the user pays $0.50 per km and an additional $3 every 5 km, the extension price, in addition to $0.50 per km. { \"last_updated\" : 1609866247 , \"ttl\" : 0 , \"version\" : \"2.2\" , \"data\" : { \"plans\" : [ { \"plan_id\" : \"plan2\" , \"name\" : \"One-Way\" , \"currency\" : \"USD\" , \"price\" : 2 , \"is_taxable\" : false , \"description\" : \"Includes 10km, overage fees apply after 10km.\" , \"per_km_pricing\" : [ { \"start\" : 10 , \"rate\" : 1 , \"interval\" : 1 , \"end\" : 25 }, { \"start\" : 25 , \"rate\" : 0.5 , \"interval\" : 1 }, { \"start\" : 25 , \"rate\" : 3 , \"interval\" : 5 } ] } ] } } Example 2: \u00b6 This example demonstrates a pricing scheme that has a rate both by minute and by km. The user is charged $0.25 per km as well as $0.50 per minute. Both of these rates happen concurrently and are not dependent on one another. { \"last_updated\" : 1609866247 , \"ttl\" : 0 , \"version\" : \"2.2\" , \"data\" : { \"plans\" : [ { \"plan_id\" : \"plan3\" , \"name\" : \"Simple Rate\" , \"currency\" : \"CAD\" , \"price\" : 3 , \"is_taxable\" : true , \"description\" : \"$3 unlock fee, $0.25 per kilometer and 0.50 per minute.\" , \"per_km_pricing\" : [ { \"start\" : 0 , \"rate\" : 0.25 , \"interval\" : 1 } ], \"per_min_pricing\" : [ { \"start\" : 0 , \"rate\" : 0.50 , \"interval\" : 1 } ] } ] } } system_alerts.json \u00b6 This feed is intended to inform customers about changes to the system that do not fall within the normal system operations. For example, system closures due to weather would be listed here, but a system that only operated for part of the year would have that schedule listed in the system_calendar.json feed. Obsolete alerts SHOULD be removed so the client application can safely present to the end user everything present in the feed. Field Name REQUIRED Type Defines alerts Yes Array Array of objects each indicating a system alert as defined below. - alert_id Yes ID Identifier for this alert. - type Yes Enum Valid values are: system_closure station_closure station_move other - times OPTIONAL Array Array of objects with the fields start and end indicating when the alert is in effect (e.g. when the system or station is actually closed, or when it is scheduled to be moved). \u2003- start Yes Timestamp Start time of the alert. \u2003- end OPTIONAL Timestamp End time of the alert. If there is currently no end time planned for the alert, this can be omitted. - station_ids OPTIONAL Array If this is an alert that affects one or more stations, include their ID(s). Otherwise omit this field. If both station_id and region_id are omitted, this alert affects the entire system. - region_ids OPTIONAL Array If this system has regions, and if this alert only affects certain regions, include their ID(s). Otherwise, omit this field. If both station_id s and region_id s are omitted, this alert affects the entire system. - url OPTIONAL URL URL where the customer can learn more information about this alert. - summary Yes String A short summary of this alert to be displayed to the customer. - description OPTIONAL String Detailed description of the alert. - last_updated OPTIONAL Timestamp Indicates the last time the info for the alert was updated. Example: \u00b6 { \"last_updated\" : 1604198100 , \"ttl\" : 60 , \"version\" : \"2.2\" , \"data\" :{ \"alerts\" :[ { \"alert_id\" : \"21\" , \"type\" : \"station_closure\" , \"station_ids\" :[ \"123\" , \"456\" , \"789\" ], \"times\" :[ { \"start\" : \"1604448000\" , \"end\" : \"1604674800\" } ], \"url\" : \"https://example.com/more-info\" , \"summary\" : \"Disruption of Service\" , \"description\" : \"The three stations on Broadway will be out of service from 12:00am Nov 3 to 3:00pm Nov 6th to accommodate road work\" , \"last_updated\" : 1604519393 } ] } } geofencing_zones.json (added in v2.1) \u00b6 Describes geofencing zones and their associated rules and attributes. Geofenced areas are delineated using GeoJSON in accordance with RFC 7946 . By default, no restrictions apply everywhere. Geofencing zones SHOULD be modeled according to restrictions rather than allowance. An operational area (outside of which vehicles cannot be used) SHOULD be defined with a counterclockwise polygon, and a limitation area (in which vehicles can be used under certain restrictions) SHOULD be defined with a clockwise polygon. Geofences and GPS operate in two dimensions. Restrictions placed on an overpass or bridge will also be applied to the roadway or path beneath. Care SHOULD be taken when developing geofence based policies that rely on location data. Location data from GPS, cellular and Wi-Fi signals are subject to interference resulting in accuracy levels in the tens of meters or greater. This may result in vehicles being placed within a geofenced zone when they are actually outside or adjacent to the zone. Transit time between server and client can also impact when a user is notified of a geofence based policy. A vehicle traveling at 15kph can be well inside of a restricted zone before a notification is received. Field Name REQUIRED Type Defines geofencing_zones Yes GeoJSON FeatureCollection Each geofenced zone and its associated rules and attributes is described as an object within the array of features, as follows. - type Yes String \u201cFeatureCollection\u201d (as per IETF RFC 7946 ). - features Yes Array Array of objects as defined below. \u2003- type Yes String \u201cFeature\u201d (as per IETF RFC 7946 ). \u2003- geometry Yes GeoJSON Multipolygon A polygon that describes where rides might not be able to start, end, go through, or have other limitations. A clockwise arrangement of points defines the area enclosed by the polygon, while a counterclockwise order defines the area outside the polygon ( right-hand rule ). All geofencing zones contained in this list are public (i.e., can be shown on a map for public use). \u2003- properties Yes Object Properties: As defined below, describing travel allowances and limitations. \u2003\u2003- name OPTIONAL String Public name of the geofencing zone. \u2003\u2003- start OPTIONAL Timestamp Start time of the geofencing zone. If the geofencing zone is always active, this can be omitted. \u2003\u2003- end OPTIONAL Timestamp End time of the geofencing zone. If the geofencing zone is always active, this can be omitted. \u2003\u2003- rules OPTIONAL Array Array that contains one object per rule as defined below. In the event of colliding rules within the same polygon, the earlier rule (in order of the JSON file) takes precedence. In the case of overlapping polygons, the combined set of rules associated with the overlapping polygons applies to the union of the polygons. In the event of colliding rules in this set, the earlier rule (in order of the JSON file) also takes precedence. \u2003\u2003\u2003- vehicle_type_id OPTIONAL Array Array of IDs of vehicle types for which any restrictions SHOULD be applied (see vehicle type definitions in PR #136 ). If vehicle_type_ids are not specified, then restrictions apply to all vehicle types. \u2003\u2003\u2003- ride_allowed Conditionally REQUIRED Boolean REQUIRED if rules array is defined. Is the undocked (\u201cfree bike\u201d) ride allowed to start and end in this zone? true - Undocked (\u201cfree bike\u201d) ride can start and end in this zone. false - Undocked (\u201cfree bike\u201d) ride cannot start and end in this zone. \u2003\u2003\u2003- ride_through_allowed Conditionally REQUIRED Boolean REQUIRED if rules array is defined. Is the ride allowed to travel through this zone? true - Ride can travel through this zone. false - Ride cannot travel through this zone. \u2003\u2003\u2003- maximum_speed_kph OPTIONAL Non-negative Integer What is the maximum speed allowed, in kilometers per hour? If there is no maximum speed to observe, this can be omitted.

The following sections describe how analytics can be added to these URIs, as well as some examples. For further examples, see \"What's New in GBFS\" . Analytics (added in v1.1) \u00b6 In all of the rental URI fields, a viewing app can report the origin of a deep link to request to a rental app by appending the client_id (added in v1.1) parameter to the URI along with the domain name for the viewing app. For example, if Google is the viewing app, it can append: client_id=google.com ...to the URI field to report that Google is the originator of the deep link request. If the Android URI is: com.abcrental.android://open.abc.app/stations?id=1234567890 ...then the URI used by Google would be: com.abcrental.android://open.abc.app/stations?id=1234567890&client_id=google.com Other supported parameters include: ad_id (added in v1.1) - Advertising ID issued to the viewing app (e.g., IFDA on iOS) token (added in v1.1) - A token identifier that was issued by the rental app to the viewing app. Examples (added in v1.1) \u00b6 Example 1 - App Links on Android and Universal Links on iOS are supported: \u00b6 system_information.json \u00b6 { \"last_updated\" : 1572447999 , \"ttl\" : 60 , \"version\" : \"2.2\" , \"data\" :{ \"system_id\" : \"abc_cityname\" , \"short_name\" : \"ABC Bike Rental\" , \"rental_apps\" :{ \"android\" :{ \"discovery_uri\" : \"com.abcrental.android://\" }, \"ios\" :{ \"discovery_uri\" : \"com.abcrental.ios://\" } } ... station_information.json \u00b6 { \"last_updated\" : 1609866247 , \"ttl\" : 60 , \"version\" : \"2.2\" , \"data\" :{ \"stations\" :[ { \"station_id\" : \"425\" , \"name\" : \"Coppertail\" , \"lat\" : 27.9563335328521 , \"lon\" : -82.430436084371 , \"rental_uris\" :{ \"android\" : \"https://www.abc.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=android\" , \"ios\" : \"https://www.abc.com/app?sid=1234567890&platform=ios\" } }, ...

Location data from GPS, cellular and Wi-Fi signals are subject to interference resulting in accuracy levels in the tens of meters or greater. This may result in vehicles being placed within a geofenced zone when they are actually outside or adjacent to the zone. Transit time between server and client can also impact when a user is notified of a geofence based policy. A vehicle traveling at 15kph can be well inside of a restricted zone before a notification is received. Field Name REQUIRED Type Defines geofencing_zones Yes GeoJSON FeatureCollection Each geofenced zone and its associated rules and attributes is described as an object within the array of features, as follows. - type Yes String \u201cFeatureCollection\u201d (as per IETF RFC 7946 ). - features Yes Array Array of objects as defined below. \u2003- type Yes String \u201cFeature\u201d (as per IETF RFC 7946 ). \u2003- geometry Yes GeoJSON Multipolygon A polygon that describes where rides might not be able to start, end, go through, or have other limitations. A clockwise arrangement of points defines the area enclosed by the polygon, while a counterclockwise order defines the area outside the polygon ( right-hand rule ). All geofencing zones contained in this list are public (i.e., can be shown on a map for public use). \u2003- properties Yes Object Properties: As defined below, describing travel allowances and limitations. \u2003\u2003- name OPTIONAL String Public name of the geofencing zone. \u2003\u2003- start OPTIONAL Timestamp Start time of the geofencing zone. If the geofencing zone is always active, this can be omitted. \u2003\u2003- end OPTIONAL Timestamp End time of the geofencing zone. If the geofencing zone is always active, this can be omitted. \u2003\u2003- rules OPTIONAL Array Array that contains one object per rule as defined below. In the event of colliding rules within the same polygon, the earlier rule (in order of the JSON file) takes precedence. In the case of overlapping polygons, the combined set of rules associated with the overlapping polygons applies to the union of the polygons. In the event of colliding rules in this set, the earlier rule (in order of the JSON file) also takes precedence. \u2003\u2003\u2003- vehicle_type_id OPTIONAL Array Array of IDs of vehicle types for which any restrictions SHOULD be applied (see vehicle type definitions in PR #136 ). If vehicle_type_ids are not specified, then restrictions apply to all vehicle types. \u2003\u2003\u2003- ride_allowed Conditionally REQUIRED Boolean REQUIRED if rules array is defined. Is the undocked (\u201cfree bike\u201d) ride allowed to start and end in this zone? true - Undocked (\u201cfree bike\u201d) ride can start and end in this zone. false - Undocked (\u201cfree bike\u201d) ride cannot start and end in this zone. \u2003\u2003\u2003- ride_through_allowed Conditionally REQUIRED Boolean REQUIRED if rules array is defined. Is the ride allowed to travel through this zone? true - Ride can travel through this zone. false - Ride cannot travel through this zone. \u2003\u2003\u2003- maximum_speed_kph OPTIONAL Non-negative Integer What is the maximum speed allowed, in kilometers per hour? If there is no maximum speed to observe, this can be omitted.","title":"geofencing_zones.json (added in v2.1)"},{"location":"reference/#example_11","text":"{ \"last_updated\" : 1604198100 , \"ttl\" : 60 , \"version\" : \"2.2\" , \"data\" :{ \"geofencing_zones\" :{ \"type\" : \"FeatureCollection\" , \"features\" :[ { \"type\" : \"Feature\" , \"geometry\" :{ \"type\" : \"MultiPolygon\" , \"coordinates\" :[ [ [ [ -122.578067 , 45.562982 ], [ -122.661838 , 45.562741 ], [ -122.661151 , 45.504542 ], [ -122.578926 , 45.5046625 ], [ -122.578067 , 45.562982 ] ] ], [ [ [ -122.650680 , 45.548197 ], [ -122.650852 , 45.534731 ], [ -122.630939 , 45.535212 ], [ -122.630424 , 45.548197 ], [ -122.650680 , 45.548197 ] ] ] ] }, \"properties\" :{ \"name\" : \"NE 24th/NE Knott\" , \"start\" : 1593878400 , \"end\" : 1593907260 , \"rules\" :[ { \"vehicle_type_id\" :[ \"moped1\" , \"car1\" ], \"ride_allowed\" : false , \"ride_through_allowed\" : true , \"maximum_speed_kph\" : 10 } ] } } ] } } }","title":"Example:"},{"location":"reference/#deep-links-added-in-v11","text":"Deep links to iOS, Android, and web apps are supported via URIs in the system_information.json , station_information.json , and free_bike_status.json files.

GBFS was created to make real-time shared mobility information available in a standardized format to support the development of traveler facing applications. GBFS specifies how shared mobility data should be structured for proper interoperability of systems. Before the creation of GBFS, bike sharing systems each used different proprietary data formats, making it difficult for application developers to create tools for travellers. Why is it important for GBFS data to be openly available? Public GBFS feeds help facilitate the discovery of mobility services, increasing access to shared mobility. They also provide transparency around businesses that are permitted to operate in the public right of way. This transparency can increase public trust of shared mobility operators and their services. Do private GBFS feeds exist? GBFS is a specification for public data, however some GBFS producers have elected to publish private feeds that require authentication using an API key or login. Great care has been taken in the development of GBFS to ensure that data contained in the specification does not adversely affect user privacy. Requiring authentication of GBFS data greatly diminishes it\u2019s value as a source of public information. What is GBFS-Private? GBFS-Private is a new project undertaken by MobilityData to develop guidance on publishing certain types of information that may be too sensitive in nature to include in public GBFS feeds. The goal of the project is to preserve public data while continuing to protect user privacy. How is GBFS different from MDS? GBFS is a real-time public data specification for consumer-facing applications, whereas MDS is not public data and is intended for use only by regulators. GBFS provides real-time data to support the discovery and use of mobility systems by travelers. MDS contains both real-time and historical data that is used by cities to monitor and regulate shared mobility operators. All MDS Provider feeds are required to also publish a public GBFS feed. What are the benefits of using GBFS? For providers, GBFS means an end to a patch-work of regulation that requires different data in different formats for each city in which they operate. Standardization provides assurance to providers that data requests can be clearly defined and are fully implementable. As a consensus-based, open source standard, providers have an equal voice along with cities in the ongoing development of the GBFS specification. Comprehensive documentation and resources are available to cities and providers alike to aid in implementation. For consumers, data standardization allows application developers to aggregate data from multiple providers across multiple markets. GBFS can eliminate the need for bespoke solutions for each mobility system. For cities, requiring GBFS data as part of a shared mobility program can help to increase access to shared mobility services. Standardization of mobility data through GBFS has resulted in a growing marketplace of data management software and services. These products and services are used to assist cities in working with GBFS data to effectively manage and regulate mobility services. Does GBFS contain personal data? GBFS does not contain personal data. Given the real-time nature of the data, as well as other safety measures such as rotating bike_id, a user\u2019s information will never be shared and a user or individual trips will not be able to be traced. Does GBFS contain operational data? GBFS does not contain operational data. GBFS only contains real-time data that is beneficial to the customer for their trips.","title":"Uses of GBFS"},{"location":"faq/uses-of-gbfs/#uses-of-gbfs","text":"Why was GBFS created?

GBFS-Private is a new project undertaken by MobilityData to develop guidance on publishing certain types of information that may be too sensitive in nature to include in public GBFS feeds. The goal of the project is to preserve public data while continuing to protect user privacy. How is GBFS different from MDS? GBFS is a real-time public data specification for consumer-facing applications, whereas MDS is not public data and is intended for use only by regulators. GBFS provides real-time data to support the discovery and use of mobility systems by travelers. MDS contains both real-time and historical data that is used by cities to monitor and regulate shared mobility operators. All MDS Provider feeds are required to also publish a public GBFS feed. What are the benefits of using GBFS? For providers, GBFS means an end to a patch-work of regulation that requires different data in different formats for each city in which they operate. Standardization provides assurance to providers that data requests can be clearly defined and are fully implementable. As a consensus-based, open source standard, providers have an equal voice along with cities in the ongoing development of the GBFS specification. Comprehensive documentation and resources are available to cities and providers alike to aid in implementation. For consumers, data standardization allows application developers to aggregate data from multiple providers across multiple markets. GBFS can eliminate the need for bespoke solutions for each mobility system. For cities, requiring GBFS data as part of a shared mobility program can help to increase access to shared mobility services. Standardization of mobility data through GBFS has resulted in a growing marketplace of data management software and services. These products and services are used to assist cities in working with GBFS data to effectively manage and regulate mobility services. Does GBFS contain personal data? GBFS does not contain personal data. Given the real-time nature of the data, as well as other safety measures such as rotating bike_id, a user\u2019s information will never be shared and a user or individual trips will not be able to be traced. Does GBFS contain operational data? GBFS does not contain operational data. GBFS only contains real-time data that is beneficial to the customer for their trips.","title":"Uses of GBFS"},{"location":"faq/working-with-gbfs/","text":"Working with GBFS \u00b6 Best Practices \u00b6 What are GBFS Best Practices? GBFS Best Practices are recommendations we provide that are not required under the specification, but that make your data amazing! They are identified in the documentation using the keywords \"SHOULD\", \"SHOULD NOT\", \"RECOMMENDED\", and \"NOT RECOMMENDED\" and are to be interpreted as described in RFC2119 , BCP 14 and RFC8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here. Why are GBFS Best Practices important? GBFS Best Practices are important so that the end user has access to the most reliable and complete information without compromising their privacy. Do GBFS validator tools check for conformance with Best Practices? Validator tools do not check for conformance with Best Practices, since they are not explicit in the specification. It is recommended to use a manual approach to ensure conformance with Best Practices. What should I do if I notice a GBFS data feed does not conform to Best Practices? If you notice a data feed does not conform to Best Practices, you can try to contact the publisher using their feed contact email found in system_information.json . How can I to propose a modification/addition to Best Practices? If you would like to propose a modification to Best Practices, please do so by either opening an Issue or Pull Request via GitHub. What does is mean to rotate bike_id and why is it important? The bike_id field is a unique identifier for each vehicle in a system. Rotating bike_id means that a vehicle\u2019s ID will change to a random string each time a rental ends. Use of persistent vehicle IDs poses a threat to user privacy. This is especially important for dockless mobility systems, where a user may end or begin their trip in front of their home or other frequently visited locations. Validation \u00b6 What does it mean to validate a GBFS feed? Using a validator ensures that your data conforms to the requirements set out by the specification. In a nutshell, a validator ensures you have a valid GBFS feed. Does MobilityData have a GBFS validator? Currently, MobilityData does not have a GBFS validator, however we have plans to build a canonical validator in 2021. In the meantime, there are a handful of community-built validators and other tools available; check out our Tools page for the list.","title":"Working with GBFS"},{"location":"faq/working-with-gbfs/#working-with-gbfs","text":"","title":"Working with GBFS"},{"location":"faq/working-with-gbfs/#best-practices","text":"What are GBFS Best Practices?
